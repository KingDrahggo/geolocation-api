/***Overview***\
1.Your app will use the geolocation API to determine
location (in latitude and longitude).
    - How to acquire latitude & longitude?
    - User input needed/ button class
2. Then you can use the Flickr API to obtain a list 
of photos that were taken near that location.
    -Potentially use ForEach to create list of photos.
    -Use If statement or Argument to distinguish course 
    of action.
3. Display the first photo on the page, along with a 
link to that photo’s Flickr page. 
    - Find way to only show only first image/ 
    link to photo.
4. Provide some method of advancing through the photos.
    - Find a way to click images side to side
    - Google CSS ways to create slide show buttons


 /***Requirements***\
 - Get geolocation from browser
    - google it
 - How do I construct query URL?
    - google it 
 - Use Fetch to send request to Flickr
    - rewatch demo
 - Turn response data into object
    - sounds easy enough but demo
 - Turn the content from the new object into image source URL
    - there is img data use src
 - Display image on page    
    - This is where you show one image at a time
 - CLickEvent to show other images
    - Setinterval or create next buttons

/***STEP_ONE***\
1. Pull up geolocation documentation
    - need to access the Geolocation object
     inside of navigator: *navigator.Geolocation*
2.Notice that the Geolocation API 
has a function for watchPosition
    - use that function to update a global variable
     with your current position whenever it changes.
3a.Attempt to watch the user’s location
    -update the location as it moves around(How?)
3b. If the geolocation API is unavailable or if the user 
refuses to allow the browser to disclose their location, 
    -display a message that you could not access their location
    -use hard-coded latitude and longitude of your choice 
    (pick someplace interesting!).

/***STEP_TWO***\
1. Get API key from Flickr
    -choose non commercial
    -put reason as "Using APi for school project"
2.Save key becuase you need for Queries
    - Ex:https://flickr.com/services/rest/?
    api_key=993fake589fake6cdfakefcb&format
    =json&nojsoncallback=1&method=flickr.photos.
    search&safe_search=1&per_page=5&lat=39.76574&lon=
    -86.1579024&text=dog
3. Photo search request must include Search term 
    - ex: If I search up "books" include it
4.Set the "lat" and "lon" values to the latitude and longitude 
that you got from the geolocation API.
5.Set the per_page count to no more than 5
6.Set safe_search to 1 to avoid potentially racy images.
7.Send request(aka fetch) to translator then Flickr
    - has to be translated first to use fetch
    -cross-origin requests 
    - look at example on assigment page: Shrouded mountain link

/***STEP_THREE***\
1.Use fetch to send the request to Flickr.
    - Covert from Json into an Object before trying to use
2.Read link about understanding response data

/***STEP_FOUR***\
1.Response Object doesnt have URL for photos
    - Needs to be assembled
    - Read link
2. Look at example code for reference on how it looks

/***STEP_FIVE***\
1.Append image to "main" element using the above URL as 
the "src" attribute
    -I dont see one so make one and append to body
2.Hopefully it fetches pretty please

/***STEP_SIX***\
1. Provide some way to allow the user to see the next photo.
    - Use click event button or setInterval(advances the next 
    photo after a certain number of seconds.)
2. After the last photo in the array is displayed, 
advancing again should show the first photo again.
